            <h3>Nathan Hugon</h3>
            <p>I am a full-stack JavaScript developer with a
            background in education as an English teacher and a love for sourdough
            baking. Initially drawn to web development as a means to share my baking
            knowledge, I strive to write code that is modular, flexible, and easy
            to read. An accompanying passion for research drives my ability to find
            and create solutions to complex problems.</p>
